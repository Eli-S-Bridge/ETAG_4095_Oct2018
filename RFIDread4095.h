 *  Together, the header file and cpp file comprise a library, or a collection
 *  of functions that can be called in a sketch.

/*The first part of this header file establishes a special data structure for 
 * storing the raw data output from an RFID tag.
 * 
 * Tags that use the EM4100 communication protocol send out a stream of data that 
 * begins with nine 1s in a row. Then you get a sequence of data chucks that consist 
 * four bits of data followed by an odd/even parity bit. If the data bits sum to an
 * odd number then the parity bit is 1, otherwise it is 0. There are ten of these
 * five-bit chunks followed by a four more partiy bits that allow for an odd/even
 * parity check on each "column" of the data stream. Then there is a stop bit 
 * (always 0) For example you could arrange a data stream as follows:
 * 
 *    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1    (nine 1s to indicate the beginning of a data stream)
 *                           (these 1s are not stored)
 *    
 *    0 1 0 0   1            (four data bits and a parity bit)
 *    0 0 1 1   0            (four data bits and a parity bit)
 *    0 1 0 1   0            (four data bits and a parity bit)
 *    0 0 0 0   0            (four data bits and a parity bit)
 *    0 0 1 0   1            (four data bits and a parity bit)
 *    1 0 1 0   0            (four data bits and a parity bit)
 *    1 1 1 1   0            (four data bits and a parity bit)
 *    0 1 1 1   1            (four data bits and a parity bit)
 *    0 1 0 1   0            (four data bits and a parity bit)
 *    1 1 0 1   1            (four data bits and a parity bit)
 *    
 *    1 0 1 0   0            (four parity bits and a stop bit)
 * 
 * This data scheme allows for error checking within the data stream. If the parity bits
 * don't match up with the data bits, there there has been a transmission error
 * 
 * The code below creates a data structure that allows the RFID data stream to be stored
 * and checked efficiently. It consists of nibbles (partial bytes) of five bits (four data
 * bits and a parity bit) arranged one after another.
